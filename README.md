# Bandcamp Release Feed

Simple React application backed by AWS CDK infra and hosted on S3 to display a chronological list of Bandcamp releases that are sent to my personal email address. Made because I'm too lazy to work through the Bandcamp release emails one by one. Web UI includes embedded player for quick previewing.
